This code is a Go program that walks through a directory structure, reads and processes `kustomization.yaml` files, and prepares payloads to be sent to a pipeline. Let's break it down:

1. Import statements:
   The program imports necessary packages for file operations, YAML parsing, and logging.

2. `Kustomization` struct:
   This struct defines the structure of the YAML data we're interested in within the `kustomization.yaml` files. It has nested structs for `CommonLabels` and `CommonAnnotations`.

3. `main()` function:
   - Sets the base directory to "environment".
   - Uses `filepath.Walk()` to traverse the directory structure.

4. File processing:
   - For each file encountered, it checks if it's a `kustomization.yaml` file.
   - If it is, it reads the file content and unmarshals it into the `Kustomization` struct.

5. Action check:
   - If the `action` label is set to "remove", the file is skipped.

6. Data extraction:
   - Extracts `opEnvironment`, `aksResourceID`, and `fullNamespaceName` from the parsed YAML.

7. Payload preparation:
   - Creates a map with the extracted data.

8. Sending payload:
   - Calls `sendPayloadToPipeline()` with the prepared payload.

9. Error handling:
   - Throughout the process, errors are logged, but processing continues for other files.

10. `sendPayloadToPipeline()` function:
    - This is a placeholder function that currently just prints the payload. In a real scenario, this would send the data to an actual pipeline.

The purpose of this program x to be automating the process of extracting specific configuration data from Kubernetes kustomization files and preparing this data to be used in a pipeline, possibly for further processing or deployment steps. It's designed to handle multiple kustomization files across a directory structure, making it suitable for managing configurations for multiple environments or services.
