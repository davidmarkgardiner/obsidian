 kube-egress-gateway, a solution for configuring fixed source IP addresses for Kubernetes pod egress traffic on Azure. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. Purpose: kube-egress-gateway provides a scalable and cost-efficient way to manage outbound traffic from Kubernetes pods with fixed source IPs.
2. Compatibility: It works with both managed (AKS) and unmanaged Kubernetes clusters on Azure, using dedicated nodes as pod egress gateways.
3. Advantage: More cost-efficient than other methods, as pods with different egress IP requirements can share the same gateway and be scheduled on any regular worker node.
4. OS Requirements: Supports only Linux-based nodes (Ubuntu or Azure Linux). Windows support is not available.
5. Deployment: Uses a StaticGatewayConfiguration Custom Resource (CR) to deploy a static egress gateway.
6. Configuration: Requires specifying gateway VMSS profile and public IP provisioning. Optional settings include BYO public IP prefix, default routing, and exclude CIDRs.
7. Status Reporting: The CR reports the egress public IP prefix or private IPs in its status.
8. Pod Usage: To use the gateway, pods need an annotation specifying the StaticGatewayConfiguration name.
9. Limitations: Existing pods must be recreated to enable the egress gateway, as it only takes effect during pod creation.

This solution aims to simplify and optimize the management of outbound traffic for Kubernetes pods on Azure, providing more flexibility and cost-efficiency compared to traditional methods.
