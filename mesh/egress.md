### User Story
As a software engineer, I want to ensure that all new features or products are peer-reviewed and verified so that they maintain a high-quality standard before merging into the main codebase.

### Acceptance Criteria
- A feature or product has been developed according to the requirements.
- The code is subjected to peer review by at least one other engineer.
- Any feedback from the peer review is addressed and the code is updated accordingly.
- The feature or product has passed all necessary automated and manual tests.
- Verification is documented and evidence of the test results is available.
- A merge request to incorporate the feature or product into the main codebase is created.
- The merge request includes all necessary documentation and test outcomes.
- The team reviews the merge request with a focus on code quality and adherence to project standards.
- Upon approval during the review process, the feature or product is merged into the release process.
- After merging, the continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline triggers any necessary builds and deployments.
