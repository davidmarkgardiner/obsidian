### Data Analysis and Preparation

### User Story and Acceptance Criteria

Based on the input data "Create automated PR in ADO", I will create a user story and acceptance criteria.

#### User Story

As a development team, I want to create an automated pull request (PR) process in Azure DevOps (ADO) so that we can streamline our code reviews and ensure consistent quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

Given that I am a development team member, 
When I create a new branch in ADO, 
Then the system should automatically create a pull request with a clear and concise summary.

When I make changes to the code, 
Then the system should automatically update the pull request with the latest changes.

When I review the pull request, 
Then I should be able to provide feedback and approve or reject the changes without manual intervention.

When the pull request is approved, 
Then the system should automatically merge the changes into the main branch.
